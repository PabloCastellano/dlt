It is complicated to navigate the sea of unstructured data, there is mountain of corpses and burned scripts
written by countless stranger and always leads to frustration. It is hard even for regular software engineers
and even harder to data engineers and data scientists because there is spectrum of options available such as

1. Simple python scripts using `requests` and `beatifulsoup` but with a lot of effort,
2. Learning frameworks like [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) or [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/),
3. Using commercial solutions,
4. Outsourcing your struggle to freelancers
